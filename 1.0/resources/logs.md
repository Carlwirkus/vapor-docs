# Logs

[[toc]]

## Introduction

As you may know, Laravel provides support for a variety of logging services. By default, when using Vapor, your application will use the AWS CloudWatch service when logging messages.

## Visualize Logs

If you have installed the [Vapor UI package](#installing-the-vapor-ui), you may access the `/vapor-ui` URL to visualize logs stored in the AWS CloudWatch service.

The Vapor UI will display the logs generated by your infrastructure and application.

Remember, even if you configure a different logging service for your application logs, the AWS CloudWatch service and Vapor UI will always display your infrastructure logs.

### Local Environment

If for some reason you can't access your application, you may want to visualize logs in your local environment. For that, you must set the following environment variables:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
VAPOR_ENVIRONMENT=
VAPOR_PROJECT=
```
